# Reconstruction of vehicle dynamics from inertial and GNSS data

[PDF LINK](https://github.com/federicoB/bachelor_thesis/blob/master/federico_bertani_tesi.pdf)

This is my bachelor thesis, written for my graduation on the 18th of july 2018 from University of Bologna (Italy).

## Abstract:

> The increasingly massive collection of data from various types of sensors installed on vehicles allows the study and reconstruction of their dynamics in real time, as well as their archiving for subsequent analysis. This Thesis describes the design of a numerical algorithm and its implementation in a program that uses data from inertial and geo-positioning sensors, with applications in industrial contexts and automotive research. The result was made usable through the development of a Python add-on for the Blender graphics program, able to generate a three- dimensional view of the dynamics that can be used by experts and others. Throughout the Thesis, particular attention was paid to the complex nature of the data processed, introducing adequate systems for filtering, interpolation, integration and analysis, aimed at reducing errors and simultaneously optimizing performances.
