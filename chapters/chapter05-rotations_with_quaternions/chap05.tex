\chapter{Rotation with quaternions}
\label{chap:rotation_with_quaternions}

This chapter deals with on usage of quaternions for rotations and in general with all of the project parts related to moving from a local frame of reference to a laboratory one.

\section{From local to laboratory}
The program calculates the change of angular positions by integrating angular velocities. The angular velocities are in a local reference frame, which means that for calculating angular position at time $t_{i+1}$ we must take in account angular position at time $t_i$: it must be gradually composed.\\

One of the first error I committed, was considering the rotation composition as the sum of angles on each axis. I was using the same integration routine used for linear dimensions that does the cumulative sum on each axis, i.e. the sum of the areas. But when composing multiple rotations, for example when having a rotation around vertical versor $\hat{z}$ by an angle $\theta_z$, besides adding $\theta_z$ to the vertical rotation, one must move rotation axis that belongs to the horizontal $xy$ plane. \\
So I divided the integration routine in two functions, one that returns an array of areas, the second that calls the first and then does the cumulative sum of the array of areas. I've done this also for keeping compatibility for others modules that were using the previous single function. \\
Then, once I had the angle variation vector $\langle\Delta\theta_x,\Delta\theta_y,\Delta\Theta_z\rangle$ the respective quaternion can be created and multiplied together. 
Essentially, the two quaternion library I used in the project overload mathematical operators, in a way more or less explicit, so composition and rotation become more straightforward. \\
For quaternion composition, initially I was using \texttt{numpy.cumprod()} \cite{numpy-cumprod} but this function was doing multiplication in the reverse order with respect to what I needed for quaternions. For example, calling \texttt{cumprod()} on a vector $\langle x,y,z,w \rangle$ will result in $\langle x,xy,xyz,zyzw \rangle$ while I needed $\langle x,yx,zyx,wzyx \rangle$  \\

So I written some custom code to make quaternion composition using \texttt{functools.reduce()} as it's faster than using a \texttt{for} cycle.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,frame=single]
quaternions = reduce(lambda array, element: [*array, element * array[-1]], 
					quaternions, 
					[initial_quaternion])
\end{lstlisting}
The reason is that lambda use local scoped variables, that can be kept in register and cache and that interpreter can preload next items.
%TODO explain previus code, comparison with for cycle, proof that is faster
%TODO talk about how to create a quaternion, difference in creating a quaternion representing a rotation from one that represent a vector to be rotated.
%TODO also talk about map for rotation


\section{World frame of reference}
There exists an additional frame of reference, similar to the laboratory one described before but with a possible rotation in the horizontal plane. \\
This frame of reference have y-axis oriented towards geographical north and x-axis to east. \\
This is critically important for mixing GNSS data that is already in this frame of reference, with integrated inertial data. \\
To find the angle between GNSS positions and east the program finds the first position that is at least 10 meters away from the initial one, then calculates the angle of this vector. \\
Assuming that the first motion of the vehicle is forward, given the previous calculated angle, all acceleration should be rotated. \\
Instead of rotating all accelerations and angular positions, the program sets only set correctly the initial position with respect to the world frame of reference. Since the following angular positions are calculated from the first, no additional operations are needed, saving the program to do a $O(n)$ operation, i.e. the rotation for all records.
