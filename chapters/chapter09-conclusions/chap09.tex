\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}

The thesis presented a software to reconstruct vehicle dynamics from inertial and GNSS data.
I integrated physics quantities with a technique suitable for not equally spaced records. Both acceleration and angular velocity are integrated and angular position is composed gradually using quaternion performance advantage.
Trajectory obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope is improved additionally by GNSS data, leading to a more precise and smooth path.
The project has been implemented in Python, mainly exploiting Numpy as Pyquaternion libraries functionalities.
I created a standalone Blender add-on which auto-installs its dependencies and offers a graphical interface. Much of the code has been proved with automated testing.

\section{Future Development}
% Better error reduction
% approximation instead on interpolation for GNSS positions
% multiple black box fusion
% Horizontal angular position correction with heading
% Change basis of interpolation, reduce error and speed up
% Parallelize
